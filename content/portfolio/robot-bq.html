		When I joined the project as an external consultant, the company had almost finished the design of the robot. I took the role of product designer for the ecosystem surrounding it.
		During 5 months my tasks were mainly:
		<ul>
			<li> Work with UX + Android team to conceptualize the mobile app</li>
			<li> Work with different teams within the company to add more value to the toy: personality, sounds, games, customization, stories, learning projects</li>
			<li> Design the journey from the unboxing to the first steps, the learning path... </li>
			<li> User testing the whole experience: Packaging, setup, mobile app</li>
			<li> Create a shared vision about the product within the company </li>
		</ul>
		Zowi was launched in Christmas 2015-2016.
