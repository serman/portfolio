            Semilla Boombox is a semi-permanent version of <a href="/portfolio/boomboxSt.html"> boomboxSt</a>, a second iteration. 
            It has been installed for a few months in a public park in Villaverde, a neighbourhood in the suburbs of Madrid. 
    <p>
            The project has been a collaboration with <a href="http://asociacion-semilla.org"> Semilla </a> and <a href="intermediae.es"> intermediae</a>. Semilla is a grassroots organization which works mainly with teenagers in risk of social exclusion. They are usually kids who left the school and through Semilla they receive non-official training in other skills to reintegrate them into the society.    
             </p>
            <p> Intermediae is a cultural institution depending on the Madrid art council. They work promoting new forms of social or participative art. 
            </p>
            <p> Together we organized a course were the participants took a major role in finding the place for the device and designing the behavior. They learned how to do things with linux, how to design web for mobile phones or work with embedded hardware, they made the logo...

            <h2>Reception</h2>
            <p>
              The project has become a major milestone within Intermediae and is an example of collaboration among creators, social organization and art institutions. 

              <br/> The reception in the neighborhood  has been very diverse. The device is used daily but it is challenging to inform all the neighbors about its history and goals.

          <h3> 2015 Update </h3>
          <p> The prototype was working during four months in the summer with a temporary agreement with the city council. Then the temporary permission ended and we went through the process of getting a permanent license. Unfortunately Semilla NGO couldn't survive to the economic crisis and disappeared. Now the project is stalled, waiting for a future revival</p>
