<p>
An interactive room designed for the new National Museum of Science And Technology (MUNCYT) in Alcobendas (Madrid).
<br/>
It is inspired by the uses, popular imagery and qualities of the four forces of the nature: strong nuclear, weak nuclear, gravity and electromagnetic.
</p>
<p>
The room contains an interactive round table, three digital mirrors, a five channel sound system and an interactive illumination system. Everything is synchronized together and sorted in four scenes one for each force.
<br/>
In each stage the player can play with the forces in different ways: manipulating electromagnetic waves, recreating nuclear explosions, colliding particles, creating black holes...
</p>


<h2> Commission: From brainstorming to production</h2>
<p>
The museum management contacted us to include something related with interactive art and science in their new building. 
</p>
<p>
When the museum was in planning stage, we designed different proposals for the available spaces.
<br/>
After the final design was approved with the museum team, Guillermo Casado and me were in charge of the engineering and development. The physical building of the spaces was subcontracted to another company. 

The installation will remain working for a year.
