                    Life cycle analysis is a super-complex
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_cycle_assessment">methodology to asses environmental impacts</a>. Beatriz &amp; Irene are researchers on this field at the School of arquitecture.

                    They both felt frustrated because the environmental thinking in society is limited to "this product is Green" and "This is not green" while actually things are much more complex.

                    <br>
                    Therefore, they attended to visualizar with the goal of making something that let them comunicate the different impacts of our consumption society and create debate about it.

                    Visualizar is a collective workshop were people from different background join together. I personally felt very interested in the field so I joined them.

                    <br>
                    During the 2 weeks workshop we decided to focus on our personal transport as a way to explain these different impacts. Otherwise is very hard to explain such a complex and messy issue if try to explain everything.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My contribution here was to think a good way to explain the complexity of the environmental issues and also to code the whole prototype.

                    <h2> Process and design motivations </h2>
                    <br>
                    I think interactivity is a good way to make people understand complex things. Instead of showing a big amount of static information. My goal was to create a tool that let people understand the impact issues through the interaction. So I wanted to make it playful and reactive to user changes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We decided we wanted to make it personal, helping people to think about their mobility decisions, so the tool is focused on building your own impact identity through a year.
