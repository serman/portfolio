<div class="textblock">Digital collateral damages is a name to describe the qualities that we enjoyed in the pre-digital world and we miss now with the digital devices. A digital collateral damage can be a house without books because all of them are in the computer or the lost of surprise while traveling through a a new territory because we are always guided by GPS.<br>
<br>
The main goal is find the qualities we liked, to bring them back to the digital age, designing digital technologies that connects better with our inherent embodied nature and desires.<br>
<br>
This is a research video sketch, but here you can see a video that briefly make some questions and draw some answers to the current state of annotating digital books.<br>
