    <div class="textblock"><h2> Project Context </h2><br>
        Castell칩n is a west region in spain with a historically strong ceramic industry. But this industry, as most of the industries related with constructions, has been quite exposed to the Spanish economic crisis. To increase market opportunities, The Ceramic Promotion Institute and the ABIO research group within Madrid School of Architecture started a project to model the qualities of the different ceramic materials according to the different  uses and the spanish legislation. 
        
            About the end of the project I was hired to design a useful tool which could transform all the results from the research into an attractive Software: This software would help architects to find the best ceramic material in their buildings providing ceramic materials a competitive advantage above other materials.

            Within a very tight schedule the team had to deliver a full design of the tool, key wireframes with the visual design and an interactive demonstrator.
            
            I worked together with the ABIO researchers to understand their work and transform it in the kind of tool that practitioners need.
            
            During this project we made wireframes, user testings, an interactive prototype in HTML and a small video to be used in presentations.

        <div class="textblock"><h2> Results </h2><br>
                The prototype was introduced to the Castellon Ceramic Institute and the ceramic industry in November 2011. Client and the industry expectations were exceed by our work and the software became one of the most important parts of the SOLCONCER project.
                Currently (oct 2012) the scientific research is over and the software will be coded probably during the next year.
