It works like a copy machine. It has two plates; in the first one the original record is placed. The second one has different molds to accommodate different kind of textile products. But in the analog world is not possible to just copy, unlike in the digital domains, copy implies loss.<br>
<br>
The work was inspired by the stakeholder, the record label “Deleted record” and the interviews with one of his artists: Noe spagato, an electro-analog artist. He likes the electronic inside of his instruments because he is able to understand it. He explained us his particular opinions about the music industry, governments and fashion that subtly impregnates our work.<br>

<h2> Scenarios 1: 2nd hand store</h2><br>
We designed Record revolver with two scenarios in mind.<br>
Second hand stores are full of junk. Crates of LP's lie in waste, created by the excessive consumer culture that has lost any kind of interest in these out dated time capsules. Record Revolver transforms these discarded LP's from their primary form to the experience that it is purposed to the user. What should be a permissible use of LP's and do they deserve to melt, only to transform the appearance of a T shirt? Do your feelings change when the LP in discussion is of value to you?</div>

<div class="textblock"><h2> Critical Design </h2><br>
Recordrevolver contains my main statements about the "critical design" movement.<br>
•   It is not a product that solves any problem or aimed to be a massive consumer product. Is not even user friendly.<br>
•   The comment is generated through the interaction with the user. He must choose an original record and decide when he wants to destroy or not.<br>
•   It can inspire different thoughts and reflections about the musical topic: Relationships between music and fashion, nature of physical and digital copies, relationships between the analog and the digital, about the lifecycle of the products…<br>
•   It is a pleasure piece: It’s nice to see it moving and drawing like a live object and even some users could find a pleasure in modifying original LPs.<br>
•   It can be take over by users to create different uses and stories.<br>
<br>
<h2>"Negative fictions" </h2><br>
<p class="quotation">“Designers somehow automatically think that design is neutral and implicitly good” Tony and Fiona encourage designers to consider both positive and negative scenarios when thinking about how new technologies become absorbed into everyday life. <br>

Scenario #1: Exclusive DJ sessions.<br>
<p style="font-size: small"><br>
Article from the “Musical trends” magazine. Number 13. Nov 2020.</p><br>
<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">The Record Revolver club.</p> </h3><br>
Between 2011 and 2012 a strange semi-secret club had a great success among the cultured high society of Stockholm. It was called the Record Revolver. According to informal interviews with members, the club took place around 20 times, almost once a month during two years. Every night the club crew paid a different DJ to play music for them. Nothing strange if it weren’t because they always looked for collectors with strange LPs, limited editions, very old records and similar stuff. The club members were mainly BoBos looking for exclusive experiences and according to the rumors their hobby there was listening songs that nobody else could listen again. Club members paid a high fee to enjoy that they were listening a unique session: the music was destroyed while it was played. The DJs had one song for every member and each one of the members received a piece of fabric with the representation of the song that was destroyed, together with a certification of authenticity and the original vinyl without that song. The DJs got big amounts of money, depending on the music that they were willing to sacrifice. It seems that after two years they stopped because they didn’t find DJs keen on destroy their exclusive collections or just because their distinguished public found another more exciting activity to spend their free time.<br>

Scenario #2. The obsessive collector<br>
</p> </h3><br>
Hans was listening his copy #201 from «Script of the bridge» when looking for another copy on eBay he found a striking device. The description said:  “Vinyl soul reaper: Remove music from an original LP and capture its secret frequencies into a piece of fabric” <br>
The auction was about to end and nobody wanted it. Hans though that the machine could be interesting, at least, and it was very cheap too, so he bid 100 Kronors for it. One hour after, the auction finished. He had won. Satisfied he kept browsing for more copies of “Script of the bridge” from The Chameleons, his favorite LP.  The night was almost over and  “View from a hill”, the last song of the LP began to sound. Hans mechanically stood up from the chair, stopped the song and played the LP from the first track again. <br>
A week later Hans got a big package. Inside there was a turntable with two plates. One of them had a plastic device in the end of the arm and the other one had a pen. <br>
Following the instructions, on the first plate he put his copy number #143 and in the other one only a piece of paper instead of fabric. Surprised he observed how, when he began to play music, the arm of the second turntable began to draw different symbols on the paper. <br>
He took off the copy  #143 from the plate and played it on his own turntable. He left stone cold while he listened how the first track of the record, was indistinguishable, covered by tons of noises.  After a few minutes, he moved again. He changed the LP again and played “View from a hill” on his new turntable. During 3 minutes the machine drew a big amount of circles, lines and waves. He did the same with his copy #43 and the same with his copy #44. The printings were almost identical with only differences in some details. Smiling he played the records again, and found that “View from a hill” was not there anymore.  “I have a huge job to do”- he thought- Wouldn’t the world be perfect if “View from a hill” would be removed from all the “Script of the bridge” copies in the world?<br>
