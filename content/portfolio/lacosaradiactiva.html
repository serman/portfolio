          La cosa radiactiva is a project which combines citizen science and activism<br/>
         
          
La Cosa Radiactiva is a road trip of engineers, musicians & artists in order to explore several sites related with radioactivity in Madrid area & other places in Spain. 

There are several sites in Spain that relate closely with the radioactive phenomenon, be it natural or man-made: uranium mines, nuclear power plants, natural radon sources, research institutes… What do dwellers who live in these places know about radioactivity? What kind of information does the government provide for inhabitants at candidate cities that could host a nuclear power plant or a nuclear waste storage facility? Are we even able to tell the difference between radioactivity and electromagnetic radiation? 

In September 2012 we started a road trip to visit some of these places, aiming to learn about nuclear history in Spain. We measured, made laser-sound performances and encouraged debate about conflicts related with radioactivity.
