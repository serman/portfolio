 	<h2> Brief:</h2>
 	The national distance university UNED wanted to show their available online courses in a different ways. They wanted something organic and radical.

 	<h2>Our design</h2>
 	<p>
 	We iterated and came up with different patterns to show their information. We drew on the tools and languages of data visualization. The result is a tool where users can find related courses using three connected circular wheels. 
 </p>
 	<p>
 	We wanted to achieve a experience completely different to the mainstream web but still keeping a good level of usability
	</p>

	The client liked the result and decided to use the tool as their front-page.
	</br>
 	We used D3 for coding
