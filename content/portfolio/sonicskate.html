Sonic Skate Plaza was the real time version of the Pablo Serret de Ena's video <a href="https://vimeo.com/38945843" > Brygger Virke utifran ett Betongbo (ChvlaVista Series I)" </a>
It was firstly developed as part of "Solid interfaces and Urban Games", a workshop that I organized at Madrid's Medialab-prado. 
<br/>
Sonic Skate Plaza is an intervention in public space where La Plaza de Las Letras (Madrid) becomes a scenario for a "skated orchestra"; an interface that generates sound compositions from the activity of the skate, used as an instrument.
</p>
<p>
This first prototype was a collaborative effort together with the different participants in the workshop. Coding: <i>Daniel P García , Fernando Lozano,  José Manuel González,  Reza Safavi . </i>Audio Tracks : <i>Hugo Sierra .</i>
</p>
After this first prototype it was included in  <a href="http://www.connectingcities.net/project/sonic-skate-plaza"> Connecting cities 2013 </a>


     <p> Later that year Sonic Skate Plaza travelled to Sao Paulo in Oct 2013 where we developed the project at large scale for the one month exhibition SP_Urban at Art Gallery Digital SESI-SP, the largest media facade in Latin America. On Avenue Paulista, a large ramp and skate park was built in the square in front of the building for the project. Sponsored by Verve Cultural. The Exhibition continued through November 2013.</p>

My participation in this project started by helping Pablo to prototype different ways of generating live audio from a skate, like adding an accelerometer below the skate.

Then a year after during the workshop, the project took another direction and I helped again doing the sound programming in pureData and some visuals for the sao Paulo installation together with Pablo and Reza.
