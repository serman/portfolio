 <div class="textblock">   
 The new party was created just in time for the elections. In a couple of months we had to build many tools for the party in order to be ready for the election. A web for the primaries, web for the campaign, a platform to create a collaborative electoral program, a crowdfounding platform. Many people joined the movement with the hope of wining the city council and taking it away of traditional political parties. I joined the digital participation group and spent quite a lot of time doing front-end coding,  basic UX and visual design for the different webs. And of course everything withing a more than tight schedule...
 <br/> (at the end we won. )
