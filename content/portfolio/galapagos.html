<p>
The Galápagos Islands, one of the most biodiverse areas on the planet, faces serious environmental problems, which are largely attributable to the scale of maritime transportation in the area. In the Itabaca Channel, located between Baltra and Santa Cruz islands, 4 boats move about 146,000 people per year including tourists and residents. As a consequence, oil spills, motor noise, exhaust gas emissions, etc. are serious threats to the environment.

<p>
A solar catamaran was selected by the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy of Ecuador as a pilot project for the adoption of a new line of research with the aim of promoting renewable energy. We applied Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to assess and compare the environmental impacts of both conventional and solar ship as a basis to discuss the replacement of conventional ships in Galápagos Islands. In order to disseminate LCA results and make an effective communication possible, we developed an interactive installation in the framework of a collective production workshop. The interactive installation combines gaming with visualization of environmental impacts to explore how solar powered transport promotes an environmentally friendly model.

<h2> Notes about the workshop </h2>
The prototype was developed in probably one of the first collaborative production workshops organized by the Central University of Quito. The process was a prototype itself to test the possibilities of creating a medialab within the university.
